## Notes for Future Checks
- **Google Traffic API**: Link currently not loading ‚Äî revisit after confirming product status in Google Maps Platform documentation.
- **State Police Feeds**: Need to contact/state-by-state research for possible real-time APIs.
- **NCRB**: Annual updates mean lag in real-time data ‚Äî use for historical risk modeling only.

## Next Step
Prioritize **HERE Location Services** + **Open Government Data** for Phase 1 MVP due to reliability, structured format, and API accessibility. Crowdsourcing module can be integrated in Phase 2 for scalability.
