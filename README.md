# SafeStreets — Real-time Safety Intelligence (WIP)

**Problem:** Urban safety in India is underserved in tech. This project aims to provide contextual safety scores for city areas, actionable insights, and visual maps — starting with one metro city.

**MVP (v0):**
- City-level and geo-tagged incident data
- Safety score: Safe / Warning / Unsafe
- Heatmap visualization
- Recommended safer alternate areas
- Stack: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Streamlit, Folium/Mapbox

**Current status:** Repo initialized. Researching data sources. Next step: data ingestion + EDA.
